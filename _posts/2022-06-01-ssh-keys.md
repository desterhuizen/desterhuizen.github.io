Cloud based systems are a major part of daily life and with that comes another vector for attackers. SSH keys mae accessing remote systems easy and secure, but managing and securing these keys are sometimes overlooked. Most SSH clients now require keys to be locked to a specific user and but with this we can see how attackers could gain access to a single user and gain ssh access to multiple hosts.

Once attackers gain access to a host they start enumerating and identify any private keys they can find on the host. Having the keys stored on disk with sufficient permissions will limit access, and addiing a password to the keys will add an additional layer of protection.

Even with a password the limiting factor here is password strength and with bruteforce tech progressing well this is only a numbers game on the time it will take to break a password.

Lets create an example private key and see how long it will take us to break a generated password of a short length.

## Latest SSH Keys - CPU

Generate a new private and public key in the current directory, setting the password to three characters. 

```
tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 3 ; echo ''
vSQ
```

```bash
ssh-keygen -f ./id_rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in ./id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in ./id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:EkQvM+NnBysIlhm6NyEhuWobtsDLDFjmXmuPAX5tvYg kali@kali
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|o..  .o          |
|oo + . .         |
|o.*   * o        |
|.+oo o * o       |
|=++ . + S .      |
|=B.o.. * .       |
|B.*.o.o .        |
| *..o= . .       |
|   .E.o .        |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Lets try and bruteforce the password using john. 

```
ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
john id_rs.hash -min-len=3 --incremental:Alnum -max-length=3 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH (SSH private keys) 32/64])
Cost 1 (KDF/cipher [0=MD5/AES 1=MD5/3DES 2=Bcrypt/AES]) is 2 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (iteration count) is 16 for all loaded hashes
Node numbers 1-20 of 20 (fork)
Note: This format may emit false positives, so it will keep trying even after
finding a possible candidate.
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
vSQ              (id_rsa)
```

## Older SSH keys - GPU

```
tr -dc A-Za-z0-9\*!</dev/urandom | head -c 6 ; echo ''
Vqaz
```

```
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.key 4096
chmod 400 private.key
ssh-keygen -y -f private.key > public.key.pub

pem2john.py private.key
```

Running the brute force om 2017 Mac Book Pro with ssh-opencl we crack the fource character password in only 52 seconds. At the moment ssh-opencl does not currently support hash version 3 and 6 which is why I used CPU the prute force the previous key. 

```

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
```

Running a similar test with a 6 character password yields a similar result
```

```

Bruteforcing password has become quite possible especially if attackers are able to liberate content. Attackers have all the time in the world, and spending minutes, hours, days or even months brute forcing a cricial infrastructure key is worth the work.

If passphrase is not a way to protect the key another option is to lock down permissions as much as possible, but permissions escalations are possible in all systems. 

The ssh key problem is not new and there are numerous commercial platforms that can be used to manage keys eg. Universal SSH Key ManagerÂ®. The problem with these solutions is cost and managment complexity.

One could load the keys into the ssh-agent and use the keys from there but then bruteforce is still possible event if much harder. 

Another option is to remove keys form the system and only loading them from a secret vault when needed. Keys can be expired after a short period of time and will not remain on the host.
